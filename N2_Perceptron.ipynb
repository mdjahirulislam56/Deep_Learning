    "### What is Perceptron?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Perceptron** is an algorithm or mathematical model used in supervised machine learning. It is the simplest type of artificial neural network and serves as a fundamental building block in deep learning. It is primarily used for binary classification tasks, deciding whether an input belongs to one class or another.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure of Perceptron\n",
    "\n",
    "A perceptron consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inputs:** Multiple input features, each with an associated weight.\n",
    "- **Summation Block:** Computes the weighted sum of the inputs.\n",
    "- **Activation Function:** A mathematical function (typically a step function) that processes the summation output and produces the final output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output is binary (0 or 1), based on whether the weighted sum passes a certain threshold.\n",

    "### Neuron vs Perceptron\n",
    "\n",

    "| **Complexity**       | Highly complex, with dendrites, soma, axon, synapses; processes various chemical and electrical signals with temporal dynamics and plasticity. | Simplified mathematical model with inputs, weights, summation, and a fixed activation function. No intrinsic memory or chemical processing. |\n",
    "| **Signal Processing**| Integrates signals over time, considers spike timing and pattern; soft thresholding and nonlinear dynamics. | Calculates weighted sum of inputs and applies a fixed activation function (usually step or sigmoid). Does not consider timing or state. |\n",
    "| **Neuroplasticity**   | Can adapt connections (synapses) dynamically throughout life based on experience (learning and memory). | Learns by updating weights during training but lacks dynamic, ongoing adaptation like biological neurons. |\n",
    "| **Memory**           | Exhibits memory through ion channel dynamics and synaptic changes, allowing flexible responses.  | Statistically learns fixed weights; output depends only on current input and weight values. |\n",
    "| **Structure**        | Composed of biological parts: dendrites (inputs), soma (cell body), axon (output), synapses (connections). | Abstract components: input vector, weight vector, summation, activation function. |\n",

    "### Perceptron as a Binary Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "The perceptron is essentially a **linear classifier** that separates data into two regions using a line (in 2D), a plane (in 3D), or a hyperplane (in higher dimensions). It makes decisions by computing a weighted sum of input features and applying a threshold (activation function) to classify inputs into one of two classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It works effectively if the data is **linearly separable**, meaning there exists a straight line (or hyperplane) that perfectly divides the classes.\n",
    "- The boundary created by the perceptron is called the **decision boundary** or **hyperplane**, which separates the input space into two distinct regions, each corresponding to a class.\n",
    "- The perceptron outputs **binary values** (0 or 1) representing the predicted class for the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitation of Perceptron\n",
    "\n",
    "The perceptron **cannot classify non-linearly separable data**. For example, it cannot solve problems like the XOR problem, where data classes cannot be separated by a straight line. This limitation arises because the perceptron’s decision boundary is always linear. To handle non-linear data, more complex models like multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) with hidden layers or other advanced neural networks are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary:**  \n",
    "While simple and effective for linearly separable data, the perceptron’s inability to handle nonlinear classification problems limits its use in more complex tasks.\n"
